OpenNFT is an integrated software package designed for neurofeedback training

OpenNFT is an integrated software package designed for neurofeedback training.
It constitutes the core technical framework for developments in this exciting new
field of neuroimaging. OpenNFT is based on best practices of Python and Matlab
software and incorporates, but is not limited to, the functionality of the SPM
and Psychtoolbox software suits. An integrated Python/Matlab framework is specifically
selected to address the needs of neurofeedback developers and users with different
background, which allows for flexibility in developments and implementations without
compromising for speed and functionality. More specifically, the OpenNFTâ€™s GUI,
synchronization module, and multi-processing core are implemented in Python, whilst
computational modules for neurofeedback are implemented in Matlab.
